short-description=A backend service which acts as a helper to fetch Journal article content. 
long-description=The features were implemented with both end-users and content authors in mind. \
 With this solution, HR personnel responsible for disseminating corporate news of different kinds, \
 now have the ability to intuitively author content without the need for any HTML or CSS knowledge.\
   The look-and-feel of the portal and its content is fully automated via smart templates that utilize\
    Liferay's categories (or taxonomy) to identify news publishing channels.  This solution also \
    provides privileged users with several areas of configuration to help organizations tailor the portal \
    and its content to their needs.The HR Portal Solution is very easy to deploy by being a hot-deployable \
    Liferay Marketplace application.  Deployment flexiblity is also key since this portal can be deployed \
    into a new or existing Liferay instance as a standalone Liferay Site.<br>\
